## About

This project implements a stochastic cellular automaton where cells evolve based on probabilistic rules rather than deterministic ones, creating dynamic and unpredictable patterns. The simulation includes tools for analyzing and visualizing the behavior of the system over time.

## Development

Built with Godot Engine 4.x and GDScript.
